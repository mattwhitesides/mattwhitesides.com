									See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like. Actually, I was fired from a fry-cook opportunity. I suppose there is a sort of Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression. Spike follows the exciting smell of blood and we follow the fairly ripe smell of Spike. Better to cut you down to size, grandma. You shut the hell up right now or so help me, I'll shut you up. Oh my god! Did it sing? Risk the pain, it is your nature. So, I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sorta ripped?

									I think calling him that is an insult to the psychotic lowlife community. She's a truck-driving magic mama! I'm a comfortador also. My entire existence was constructed by a sociopath in a sweater vest; what do you suggest I do? You'd best make peace with your dear and fluffy Lord. Seems odd you'd name your ship after a battle you were on the wrong side of. Battle wounds are nothing new to me, preacher. Sweetie, if he had a tussle with that Sasquatch, we'd be in the dirt right about now, scooping up the Captain's teeth.

									Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes. Every single person down there is ignoring your pain because they're too busy with their own. It's like somebody slaughtered an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog. Either blow us all up or rub soup in our hair. It's a toss-up. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. My entire existence was constructed by a sociopath in a sweater vest; what do you suggest I do? Oh Spike, devour me! I'm the one who brings about the thought-pocalypse.
